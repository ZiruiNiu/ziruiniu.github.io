I am currently a Ph.D. student in control theory at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), UK, under the supervision of [Dr. Giordano Scarciotti](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/g.scarciotti) in the [MAC-X lab](https://giordanoscarciotti.com/mac-x-lab/). My Ph.D. is supported by the CSC-Imperial Scholarship. My research interests include output regulation, adaptive control, hybrid systems, model reduction, and robust control. 

I was the recipient of the MSc Control Systems Outstanding Achievement Prize (2021) and the Hertha Ayrton Centenary Prize (2021) for outstanding performance in MSc Control Systems and the outstanding masterâ€™s thesis in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, respectively.
