## Project Experiences

### Project A: Pandemic Modelling in Small Environments 
  * Independent Researcher – MSc Project
  * Dec. 2020 - Sept. 2021
  * This project designed and constructed a new deterministic compartmental model for COVID-19 in the University and analyzed different control strategies by optimal control technique to balance the trade-off between maintaining good quality on-campus teaching and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Including:
      * Constructed a model for COVID-19 in the University that indicated the roles of students, staff, and environment.
      * Derived analytic expression of $R_0$ in this case and analyzed the model stability at the equilibrium point.
      * Simulated the epidemic evolution in the University when no control measures are conducted.
      * Defined control variables corresponding to the effectiveness of different possible measures and suggested better control scenarios by solving optimal control problems upon the designed system model.

### Project B: Predictive Control of Laboratory-Scale Gantry Crane
  * Independent Researcher
  * Jan. 2021 - Mar. 2021
  * The project aimed to design a closed-loop Model Predictive Control (MPC) system to move the crane and pendulum from a starting point to the target without violating physical, timing and work constraints. Including:
      * Derived nonlinear expression of the dynamic system and state-space expression of the linearized model.
      * Designed a receding horizon control optimization problem with physical, timing and work constraints.
      * Applied the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Technique based on the Single-Full-Newton-Step Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) technique to implement nonlinear MPC.
      * Implemented decreasing horizon, move blocking, warm starting and sparse formulation techniques to save computational efforts.

### Project C: Test and Implementation of Wind Power Generation Control System
  * Independent Researcher – Final Year Project
  * Oct. 2019 - Mar. 2020
  * Based on Simulink and dSPACE platforms, the project aimed to investigate hardware and software implementation for the direct-drive wind turbine with a permanent-magnet synchronous generator. Different control algorithms were studied both in the Simulink simulation and on the practical turbine. Including:
      * Designed and constructed a controllable AC-DC converter.
      * Implemented and evaluated three typical maximum power point tracking (MPPT) strategies (TSR, fixed-step HCS, variable-step HCS) both in the Simulink simulation and on the practical turbine. 
      * Proposed some novel modifications to an existing variable-step HCS algorithm of MPPT strategy.

### Project D: Tactile Mouse Wheel (Haptic Revolver) for Virtual Reality (VR)
  * Team Leader
  * Dec. 2018 - Feb. 2019
  * Led a team in developing a haptic revolver for VR users designed to deliver tactile feedback. When a user interacts with virtual objects or slides his/her finger across surfaces in VR, the device provides precise haptic sensations to the fingertip, enhancing the immersive experience. My job includes:
      * Constructed a 3D model of the mouse shell with the software Rhino to get the shell printed by a 3D printer.
      * Created the VR game scene in Unity, studied the Bluetooth communication between the Unity environment and Arduino, and wrote C\# script for signal transmission purposes. 
      * Tested and debugged the Arduino code for the step motor and Servo that other team members produced.
